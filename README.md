# Optimize-ModPackage
A PowerShell function for optimizing, repairing and repackaging SCS mod packages in raw/extracted, ZipFS (soonâ„¢) and HashFS formats.

### This is a work in progress - Here be bugs and critters, so make sure to make a backup before processing a mod!

Requires PowerShell 7.0 or higher.

For automatic unpacking and repackaging of HashFS v2 packages you'll require the SCS Packer executable:
